Geneticist: What would you like to know more about?
-> Tell me more about the life form that produces the cores.
-> Did you happen to ever see my sister, Clara Frankl, during your time here?

Geneticist: Yes I recall my time as neighbor to Clara and her outpost. We were not on good terms.
Geneticist: We fought often. She and that pit stop of hers did nothing but aid in the genocide.
-> Genocide? That's a strong word. I've certainly heard the 'gold rush' years called that, but aren't the life forms incapable of suffering
    or any other sensation to our knowledge?
Geneticist: You're wrong to assume that. And I hope you're not implying I don't know the difference between deforestation and genocide.
Geneticist: The Coreols Magni are cessile animal analogues. We still know far less about their biology than you seem to think.
-> What makes you think they are conscious?
Geneticist: They have no brain analogues. Only the Cores. 
Geneticist: We both know that the cores are amplifiers for strong AI entities and that they don't do this by emulating any known version of 
    hardware acceleration. 
Geneticist: The cores appear inert but only because we are looking for neurons. We know that the organisms that bear these structures have 
    intelligently assembled a variety of other Sheol organisms with certain 'skills'. 
-> Yes, I've heard that they associate in these modular meta creatures.
Geneticist: Yes, and those creatures can only form with the core bearing life form itself.
-> But surely this could happen without consciousness.
Geneticist: It's not for me to say. We are only familiar with human consciousness. But these organisms have memories,
    and they are inarguably flexible. They can fit into such varied configurations of symbiotic life. There has to be 
    logic. I believe that they feel the horror and the pain when these 'prospectors' take what suits them, and damn the rest when it 
    inevitably withers and dies without the core.
